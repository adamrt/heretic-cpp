# Heretic. A toolkit for Final Fantasy Tactics 

C++, sokol, imgui, glm

- `make bootstrap` will get the deps, build shaders, etc
- `make [debug|release]` will build
- `./heretic` will run

If you want to use LSP you can run `bear -- make` to generate the `compile_commands.json`.

Massive thanks to the https://ffhacktics.com community and particularly @matyas
for sharing code and providing lots of pointers to docs and details.
